        <p> Hello! My name is Corbin Meacham and I am from Idaho. I enjoy a lot of outdoor activities, such as motorcycle riding and camping, as well as spending time with my family. I am also an avid hunter and fisherman and have enjoyed those things since I was very young. I grew up in Boise, Idaho, USA, and did not move away until I attended my undergrad courses at ISU in Pocatello, Idaho. After two years studying there, I got accepted to the pharmacy program at the Meridian Campus for ISU and moved back home to attend school from there. I completed my first year there, and then was diagnosed with a brain tumor. So, I put in for a medical leave while I prepped for doctor visits and decided, in the meantime, to take some online classes through BYU-I pathways. I am currently looking into some sort of coding or programming career as a fallback plan. Just in case I cannot return to pharmacy school in the future. So far, I am quite enjoying these classes and have learned so much in the past three weeks. I am starting to feel like I might be a grandmaster at coding by the time these seven weeks are up. I look forward to learning more along side each of you as this semester progresses. </p>

        <p> Idaho is one of the states located in the northwest section of the United States. It is located directly above the state line between Nevada and Utah. It is very well know for its potato production and also its scenic outdoor views. I currently live in Boise, which is the capital of this great state.</p>
